My setup for a new machine.

## Mac Install

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the repo directory
- run the script:

```shell
./fresh-setup.sh
```

## Ubuntu Install

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the repo directory
- there are a lot of manual steps for now but also some packages that are needed explained in [./ubuntu/install-steps.md](./ubuntu/install-steps.md)
